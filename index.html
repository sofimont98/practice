            <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
            <p> Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specifics tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers </p>
            <p> We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightnment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C,WaSP, and the major browser creators</p>

            <p> There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. Talos aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existingdesigns in the list. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.  </p>
            
            <p> CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demostrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to creaty beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further  </p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements only or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Talos Digital is about funtional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>
            
            <p>Luckily, designing this way showes how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days -- especially when you factor in mobile -- pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every plataform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Andrios browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
            
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minumun, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the point of needing another talos-related design.</p>
